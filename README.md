Text - classification neural network that determines the topic of a news article. The model is made with KERAS and converted to Javascript 
for deployment purposes. The model was trained with text - preprocessing functions that are easy to replicate in Javascript and still 
maintains accuracy. Next steps for the model: include encoding functions that expand beyond basic binary. (count, tf-idf), make the model
function more efficient to load on a larger scale. 


Only works in node currently. Working on getting it to work in the browser.
